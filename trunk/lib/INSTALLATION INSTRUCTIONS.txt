-----------------------------------------
       *NIX Installation Instructions:
-----------------------------------------
1.  Copy ./dist/DB-SVG.war into your Tomcat (or similar Java Server) WebApps directory.
2.  Create the following directory: /DB-SVG/ and allow the Tomcat user permission to read and write from it.
3.  Edit dbs.xml to match your databases and copy it into the /DB-SVG/ folder.
4.  Restart Tomcat

-----------------------------------------
       Windows Installation Instructions:
-----------------------------------------
Same as above, except create the directory at C:\DB-SVG\, and you will need to modify your 
tomcat server context.xml settings to the following: (CATALINAHOME\conf\context.xml)
    <WatchedResource>WEB-INF/web_windows.xml</WatchedResource>
    
    Alternatively may be able to change the path in the web.xml 
    after tomcat has unpacked the war, or you can download the source, 
    rename web_windows.xml to web.xml and rebuild the war file.
